# Analyzing-XSS-on-Django
Analyze XSS Attacks on Modern Web Frameworks using Django


## Overview

This project explores how various Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) attacks can be performed on a Django-based blog application. It highlights common security misconfigurations, such as the misuse of template filters (like `|safe`) and client-side vulnerabilities, to demonstrate **Stored**, **Reflected**, and **DOM-Based XSS** in modern web frameworks.
